errno handling is faster than exception handling.

there is no primitive-types to string in C, use sprintf functions family.



char *  itoa ( int value, char * str, int base );
This function is not defined in ANSI-C and is not part of C++, but is supported by some compilers.

A standard-compliant alternative for some cases may be sprintf:

    sprintf(str,"%d",value) converts to decimal base.
    sprintf(str,"%x",value) converts to hexadecimal base.
    sprintf(str,"%o",value) converts to octal base.
